# Compressed CHO sets generator 
This project uses the [Europeana OAI-PMH service](https://api.europeana.eu/oai/record/) to periodically harvest all
 Cultural Heritage Objects (CHOs) in the Europeana database and turn them into compressed sets so people can
 download those.

<b>Please do not use this software to generate your own sets because this will 
will take multiple days to complete and requires more than 2 TB of disk space.</b> 

Instead you can download the sets we generate periodically for you (download location will be made available later
as this project is still 'work in progress')
